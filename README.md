# Auton-Creation-Tool
This is a simple tool that allows my team (and anyone else that would like to use it) to create autons using ez-template much quicker. Though it does have some issues, such as the fact that it will always assume that you want to turn towards the next point and drive forward to reach it, the tool allows for quick iterating without even having the robot.
